    <string name="question1"> An SQLite database can be used in an android app for saving structured data</string>
    <string name="question2"> SQLite provides security for data in your applications  </string>
    <string name="question3"> You can create a db using the execSQL() method  </string>
    <string name="question4"> To create a table in the database you need to first override
        the onCreate() method within the subclass of SQLiteOpenHelper </string>
    <string name="question5"> To put information into a database you cannot create your own user method</string>
    <string name="question6"> the syntax of an SQLite database is as follows:
SQLiteDatabase mydatabase = openOrCreateDatabase("your database name",MODE_PRIVATE,null);
  </string>
    <string name="question7"> To delete information in the database you do not require a
        selection criteria that identifies the rows  </string>


    <string name="question8">Content providers act as a layer between the DB and the activity
        and manage access to a central repository of data  </string>
    <string name="question9">An advantage of a content provider is that it is a good abstraction layer between the data source and the
        UI code so it can add data validation, manage a structured set of data and modify how the data is stored </string>
    <string name="question10">A content provider can help in easily sharing data with other apps </string>
    <string name="question11">A contract is used to interact with the database itself to draw out information </string>
    <string name="question12"> A contract is used to contact the content provider  </string>
    <string name="question13"> A content provider knows which app you want to draw information from without specifying  </string>
    <string name="question14">All apps use the same content provider</string>


    <string name="question15"> To access data in your content provider you use a content resolver object  </string>
    <string name="question16"> A content resolver resolves the content within an application by
        providing resulting queries </string>
    <string name="question17">An app talks to the resolver and calls the appropriate methods to the provider </string>
    <string name="question18"> Content resolvers act like a middle man and determines
        which provider will handle the URI   </string>
    <string name="question19"> In the video, the google+ app draws out information from the contacts
        app directly through using a content provider</string>
    <string name="question20">A content resolver uses the same methods of create(), read(), update() and delete()
        corresponding to the abstract methods of a content provider i.e. query(),
        insert(), update() and delete() </string>
    <string name="question21">There is a content resolver for each app  </string>
