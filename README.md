# DatabaseQuizApp
This app is mainly designed for Nexus 5X or Android 9 API 28. Use this for suitable layout.

The app introduces the users to a learning interface by providing a "learning" option through YouTube videos and a "quiz" option to test the students on their knowledge of the topic.

The content covered will be from both the YouTube videos and the lectures from Moodle. This comes with the assumptions that students
have read the lecture notes before hand.

The umbrella topic is database applications. However, the application will focus on 3 main areas of a database application: SQLite,
Content Provider and Content Resolver.

The app will provide students feedback upon their answer for each question and a final grade will be given at the end of the quiz.
