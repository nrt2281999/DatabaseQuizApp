# DatabaseQuizApp
This app is mainly designed for Nexus 5X or Android 9 API 28. Use this for suitable layout.
Purpose is to educate students of UNSW to learn more about database applications.

Introduction:
1. The app introduces the users to a learning interface by providing a "learning" option through YouTube videos and a "quiz" option to test the students on their knowledge of the topic.
2. The content covered will be from both the YouTube videos and the lectures from Moodle. This comes with the assumptions that students
have read the lecture notes before hand.
3. The umbrella topic is database applications. However, the application will focus on 3 main areas of a database application: SQLite,
Content Provider and Content Resolver.
4. The app will provide students feedback upon their answer for each question and a final grade will be given at the end of the quiz.

Instructions for setting up the app:
1. There should not be any problems, just run the app as normal.
2. Remember to use Nexus 5X API28 for optimal layout.
3. Install Build Tools revision 28.0.3 if asked to run the app when in Android Studio

Instructions for using the app:
1. At the start screen, click next to move to the general information about the topic.
2. From here, click next to keep viewing the information and eventually it will take the user to the main menu.
3. From here, there are 2 options for the user. Either to learn first then take the quiz or just take quiz right away.
4. Assuming the users do not have sufficient knowledge, as they click "learn", this will take them to a screen with 3 different topics, each with a different YouTube video to teach them.
5. After each video ends, the user will be taken back to the main menu where he/she can choose to do the quiz.
